preparation of the practical session for the 5-second test to check usability and first impressions

I dedicated myself to make the preparations on the topic that we found for our practical session. It is a test 
that is about a method of user research that help to measure what information users take away and what impression
 they get within the first five seconds of viewing a design. They're commonly used to test whether web pages are 
 effectively communicating their intended message.

The preparations consist of the creation of the document with all the explanation of the subject and the dynamics 
and the way in which it had to be carried out for an optimal implementation, in addition to the necessary materials
 for the same that were pages previously selected to present them in a slide and in addition to which a series of
  questions would have to be answered in a questionnaire created in google
