Reanalysis of the project

the entire team was tasked with redoing each document from the first installment, 
in my case I was in charge of redoing the data collection plan all the team agreed 
that the same method was no longer possible and we opted to Interviews which I believe
 and were later approved by the team. Finally, the person in charge of carrying out the 
 online interviews was my colleague Rico Mart√≠n, now with the valuable information he 
 will be able to start extracting requirements for the application.
