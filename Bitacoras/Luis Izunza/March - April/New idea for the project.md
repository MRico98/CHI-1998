New idea for the project

The current situation forced us to change our mind for our final project now we are focusing on the topic of occupational 
therapy which tries to help people throughout their lives to participate in the activities and tasks they want and need 
perform through the therapeutic use of daily activities (occupations). Some common occupational therapy interventions 
include helping children with disabilities participate in school and social situations, helping people who are recovering 
from injuries, and providing services for older adults who are experiencing cognitive and physical changes. and all this 
focused on the vulnerable population of older adults.
