investigation of the Hicks concept

I found this concept very interesting so I decided to investigate the best to be able to use it in the interfaces of 
our project Hick's law is a psychological principle which states that the more options are available to a person, the 
longer it will take for him or her to make a decision about which option is best. Hick's law is also sometimes referred 
to as the Hick-Hyman law.

Named for psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, the law provides a logarithmic function which models the
 reaction time (RT) required to make a decision:
RT = a + b log2(n)
In this function, n is the number of choices while a and b are constants which depend on the circumstances of the
 decision being made.
