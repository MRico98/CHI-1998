visit to FabLab Yucatán

The FabLab Yucatán is part of a center for social innovation and sustainability, therefore, 
it is dedicated to encouraging people to use and develop technology. The staff that day gave
us a tour of the local headquarters of this organization. In particular, they showed us the 
progress and results of a project of local environmental importance.
