Information gathering tool for projects - persona

We create a “persona” base through the tool provided by the teacher in
this we look for the most important points related to the information
required by a home automation system in which each point is explained
its advantages and benefits by including them as part of the project. It
would be useful to use this tool in complicated situations related to the
project by the end of the semester. Our team plans to use this tool.
