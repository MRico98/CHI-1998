article called the many faces of facebook

This was an investigation on topics related to the HCI subject of scientific articles where the teacher 
provided us with a tool to facilitate the comprehension and recognition of the important parts of the 
reading. I focused on this article which talked about how people leave traces of his personal life in 
social networks and emphasized what the people who owned that information did with it, that is, 
how they managed their old information and also how the users owners and non-owners of that information 
perceived their existence for example they felt invaded if someone looks for old photos of them in their
profile but they did nothing to remove them from there.
